About DAS
---------

The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) defines a communication protocol
used to exchange biological annotations. It is motivated by the idea
that annotations should not be provided by single centralized databases,
but instead be spread over multiple sites. Data distribution, performed
by DAS servers, is separated from visualization, which is done by DAS
clients.

DAS is a client-server system in which a single client integrates
information from multiple servers. It allows a single machine to gather
up genome annotation information from multiple distant web sites,
collate the information, and display it to the user in a single view.
Little coordination is needed among the various information providers.

DAS is heavily used in the genome bioinformatics community. Over the
last years we have also seen growing acceptance in the protein sequence
and structure communities.

The BioDAS web site is hosted by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation.
Thanks to [The Bioteam](http://www.bioteam.net/) for providing and
maintaining the bio\* servers.
