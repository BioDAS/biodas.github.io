Mailing Lists
-------------

Just so we don't create confusion over DAS/1 vs. DAS/2 issues, there are
separate discussion lists for issues related to these very different
versions of the spec. For general discussions, use the DAS/2 list.

### DAS/1 Discussion list

### DAS/2 Discussion list

-   Post to: das2@biodas.org

### DAS Announcements

Teleconference
--------------

The biweekly DAS/2 teleconference has been canceled as of the end of
October, when funding for the DAS/2 grant officially expired. Notes from
past conferences between 2005-2007 are available from the link below.
