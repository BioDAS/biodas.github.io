== Mailing Lists ==

Just so we don't create confusion over DAS/1 vs. DAS/2 issues, there are separate discussion lists for issues related to these very different versions of the spec. For general discussions, use the DAS/2 list.

== Biweekly Teleconference ==

Anyone interested in the last developments in the DAS world is welcome to tune into the biweekly teleconference. The teleconference is primarily a means of coordination between the different centers involved in the DAS/2 grant, though broader discussion often occurs as well.
