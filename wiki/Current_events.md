A BioDAS project update will be presented at the [2008
BOSC](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2008) (Bioinformatics Open
Source Conference), a two day Special Interest Group meeting in
conjunction with the [ISMB](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2008/) conference.
This year's BOSC will be held 18th-19th July in Toronto, Canada.

European School in Bioinformatics, May 2008
-------------------------------------------

The BioSapiens ESB is an intensive five-day course that combines
lectures and hands-on tutorials to help the participants actively learn
and resolve biologically relevant problems. The 8th ESB is to be held
12th-16th May at the European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK and
focuses on using Europeâ€™s core biological data resources and associated
tools to analyse biological data. The first day of the course focuses on
DAS.

See
<http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/handson/course_080512_biosapiens.html>
for more details.

school](/wiki/EuropeanSchoolBioinformatics200805 "wikilink")

BioSapiens DAS workshop, Feb 2008
---------------------------------

The BioSapiens Network of Excellence are organising a 2-day workshop on
DAS, held 25th-26th February 2008 at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus,
Hinxton, UK. For more information see
<http://www.dasregistry.org/course.jsp>.

### Day 1

Similar to the DAS client developers workshop from last year, this is
the day where developers present their DAS related applications,
websites and discuss new ideas.

-   present the progress over the last year
-   find synergies
-   see if/how interoperability can be improved
-   discuss possible future extensions to DAS

See <http://www.dasregistry.org/course.jsp> for slides.

### Day 2

This is the practical day where you can learn how to work with DAS.

-   learn what you can do with DAS
-   how to talk to a DAS server
-   how to set up your own servers

See [DASworkshop200802](/wiki/DASworkshop200802 "wikilink") for slides.

BioSapiens DAS workshop, Feb 2007
---------------------------------

The Biosapiens Network ( <http://www.biosapiens.info/> ) is a project
that has a strong commitment to DAS and has been very pro-active in
setting up DAS/1 servers (lots of protein data) and developing DAS
clients.

Around this EU-wide collaboration they are organizing two DAS-related
workshops. They will both be held in the last week of February, location
is the Genome Campus in Hinxton / Cambridge, U.K.

### workshop 1

DAS client developers workshop Monday 26/2/2007 main organizer: Andreas
Prlic for more info please see:

### workshop 2

BioSapiens Feature Classification (Ontology) Workshop Tuesday,
27/2/2007, Wednesday, 28/2/2007 main organizer: Henning Hermjakob
Summary:

  
*We propose to develop a hierarchical classification of DAS feature
types based on the [OBO](http://obo.sourceforge.net/) format and
existing feature ontologies like the [Sequence
Ontology (SO)](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=SO).
This will then be the standard BioSapiens feature classification. This
will allow clients to easily implement a meaningful default view for
features as well as a user-friendly browser configuration by e.g. only
showing feature groups of interest. We also propose to annotate features
with default servers, so that e.g. structural features for a protein are
only shown from one server in default views.*
