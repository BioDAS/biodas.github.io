== European School in Bioinformatics, May 2008==

The BioSapiens ESB is an intensive five-day course that combines lectures and hands-on tutorials to help the participants actively learn and resolve biologically relevant problems. The 8th ESB is to be held 12th-16th May at the European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK and focuses on using Europeâ€™s core biological data resources and associated tools to analyse biological data. The first day of the course focuses on DAS.

See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/handson/course_080512_biosapiens.html for more details.

see  [[EuropeanSchoolBioinformatics200805| the DAS slides of the school]]

== BioSapiens DAS workshop, Feb 2008==

The BioSapiens Network of Excellence are organising a 2-day workshop on DAS, held 25th-26th February 2008 at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK. For more information see http://www.dasregistry.org/course.jsp.

===Day 1===

Similar to the DAS client developers workshop from last year, this is the day where developers present their DAS related applications, websites and discuss new ideas.
* present the progress over the last year
* find synergies
* see if/how interoperability can be improved
* discuss possible future extensions to DAS

See http://www.dasregistry.org/course.jsp for slides.

===Day 2===
 
This is the practical day where you can learn how to work with DAS.
* learn what you can do with DAS
* how to talk to a DAS server
* how to set up your own servers

See [[DASworkshop200802]] for slides.

== BioSapiens DAS workshop, Feb 2007==

The Biosapiens Network ( http://www.biosapiens.info/ ) is a project 
that has a strong commitment to DAS
and has been very pro-active in setting up DAS/1 servers (lots of 
protein data) and developing DAS clients.

Around this EU-wide collaboration they are organizing two DAS-related 
workshops. They will both be held in the last week of February, location is the 
Genome Campus in Hinxton / Cambridge, U.K.

===workshop 1===
DAS client developers workshop
Monday 26/2/2007

===workshop 2===
BioSapiens Feature Classification (Ontology) Workshop
Tuesday, 27/2/2007, Wednesday, 28/2/2007
main organizer: Henning Hermjakob
Summary:

:''We propose to develop a hierarchical classification of DAS feature types based on the [http://obo.sourceforge.net/ OBO] format and existing feature ontologies like the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=SO Sequence Ontology (SO)]. This will then be the standard BioSapiens feature classification. This will allow clients to easily implement a meaningful default view for features as well as a user-friendly browser configuration by e.g. only showing feature groups of interest. We also propose to annotate features with default servers, so that e.g. structural features for a protein are only shown from one server in default views.''
