== BioSapiens DAS workshop, Feb 2007==

The Biosapiens Network ( http://www.biosapiens.info/ ) is a project 
that has a strong commitment to DAS
and has been very pro-active in setting up DAS/1 servers (lots of 
protein data) and developing DAS clients.

Around this EU-wide collaboration they are organizing two DAS-related 
workshops. They will both be held in the last week of February, location is the 
Genome Campus in Hinxton / Cambridge, U.K.

workshop 1:
DAS client developers workshop
Monday 26/2/2007
main organizer: Andreas Prlic

workshop 2:
BioSapiens Feature Classification (Ontology) Workshop
Tuesday, 27/2/2007, Wednesday, 28/2/2007
main organizer: Henning Hermjakob
Summary:

:''We propose to develop a hierarchical classification of DAS feature types based on the [http://obo.sourceforge.net/ OBO] format and existing feature ontologies like the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=SO Sequence Ontology (SO)]. This will then be the standard BioSapiens feature classification. This will allow clients to easily implement a meaningful default view for features as well as a user-friendly browser configuration by e.g. only showing feature groups of interest. We also propose to annotate features with default servers, so that e.g. structural features for a protein are only shown from one server in default views.''
