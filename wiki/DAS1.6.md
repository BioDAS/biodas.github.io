DAS 1.6 is, as of 19th October 2010, the latest official version of DAS.
The specification document is found here: [DAS 1.6
specification](http://www.biodas.org/documents/spec-1.6.html)

The DAS specification is a technical document but with some effort
should hopefully be readable and understandable by people without a deep
understanding of broader technical issues and other system
architectures. That is, it makes only basic assumptions.

Purpose
-------

It is the first official version published in several years, and aims
to:

-   clarify ambiguities in the previous DAS specification
-   better reflect how DAS is being used in the community today
-   better reflect the use of DAS beyond the genome-centric arena
    (protein sequences and structures)
-   ratify commands from the [1.53E extended
    spec](http://www.dasregistry.org/spec_1.53E.jsp)
-   introduce some ideas inspired by DAS/2
-   formally introduce the DAS registry
-   migrate from the use of DTDs for describing the XML formats to
    RelaxNG

Development
-----------

The specification was developed as a community collaboration via
progression through a number of drafts:

-   [Draft 1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft1/documents/spec.html)
-   [Draft 2](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft2/documents/spec.html)
-   [Draft 3](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft3/documents/spec.html)
-   [Draft 4](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft4/documents/spec.html)
-   [Draft 5](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft5/documents/spec.html)
-   [Draft 6](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft6/documents/spec.html)
-   [Draft 7](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft7/documents/spec.html)

-------------

between different versions of the specification may wish to consult the
