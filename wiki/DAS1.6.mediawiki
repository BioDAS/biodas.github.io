=Distributed Sequence Annotation System (DAS) 1.6=

This is a working document and a proposal for a reworked DAS specification which hopes to:
* clarify the existing DAS spec
* better reflect how DAS is being used in the community today
* better reflect the use of DAS beyond the genome-centric arena (protein sequences and structures)
* ratify commands from the [http://www.dasregistry.org/spec_1.53E.jsp 1.53E spec] 
* introduce some ideas inspired by DAS/2
* formally introduce the DAS registry
* migrate from the use of DTDs for describing the XML formats to RelaxNG

Note: the DAS specification is a technical document but with some effort should hopefully be readable and understandable by people without a deep understanding of broader technical issues and other system architectures. That is, it makes only basic assumptions.

The specification has been written as a number of drafts:
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft1/documents/spec.html Draft 1]
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft2/documents/spec.html Draft 2]
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft3/documents/spec.html Draft 3]
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft5/documents/spec.html Draft 5]
