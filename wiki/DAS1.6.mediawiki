[http://www.biodas.org/documents/spec-1.6.html DAS 1.6] is, as of 19th October 2010, the latest official version of the DAS specification.

It is the first official version published in several years, and aims to:
* clarify ambiguities in the previous DAS specification
* better reflect how DAS is being used in the community today
* better reflect the use of DAS beyond the genome-centric arena (protein sequences and structures)
* ratify commands from the [http://www.dasregistry.org/spec_1.53E.jsp 1.53E spec] 
* introduce some ideas inspired by DAS/2
* formally introduce the DAS registry
* migrate from the use of DTDs for describing the XML formats to RelaxNG

The DAS specification is a technical document but with some effort should hopefully be readable and understandable by people without a deep understanding of broader technical issues and other system architectures. That is, it makes only basic assumptions.

The specification was developed via progression through a number of drafts:
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft1/documents/spec.html Draft 1]
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft2/documents/spec.html Draft 2]
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft3/documents/spec.html Draft 3]
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft4/documents/spec.html Draft 4]
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft5/documents/spec.html Draft 5]
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft6/documents/spec.html Draft 6]
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~aj/1.6_draft7/documents/spec.html Draft 7]
