==Day 3==

===Suggested Topics:===

 Content negotiation and efficient data formats

 how / if the big amounts data can be served via das

 DAS for high-density quantitative data.

 1: From molecules to sets. 2: Other dimensions: Samples.

 Writing a DAS client in C

 Running DAS on amazon or google app engine. And seeing what changes have to be made to the dazzle code to enable this. I'd favour app engine.

 speeding up annotation retrieval for multiple segment IDs (e.g. retrieving all features for a big alignment)

 using jsDas with JalviewLite
