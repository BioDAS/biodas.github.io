===Suggested Topics:===

==Discussion about fitting alternative data formats into the DAS ecosystem (TAD)==

See [[DAS1.6E#Support_for_alternative_content_formats|proposal from 2010 workshop]].

==Security - authorization and authentication for clients, servers, registry (GS, AJ, JW)==
==Genome alignments in DAS (TAD)==
[[DAS1.6E#Alignment|Some background]].

==Improving interactivity of DAS data (TAD)==

Can we extend DAS to give better support for more interactive client navigation?
Things like next/previous feature buttons.

Customized html labels/pop ups? (JW)

==Dasobert 2==
Improvements, Schema Driven? (JW, RJ))

==Pagination in features response==
For search functionality (or in general?) (GS, AJ, RJ, JW, LG)
==Philosophy of validation, spec compliance - client vs server expectations==
Should the DAS registry say list all sources and just give information on their validity rather than archiving sources.
Should clients do all they can to accommodate poor data sources or should they link to validation data and encourage correct data source compliance?(JW)
