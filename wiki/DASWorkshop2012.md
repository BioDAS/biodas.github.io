### Recent developments since the last workshop

DAS writeback, DAS search, Registry CRUD via web service (get, post,
put, delete), Registry supports JSON for all requests and responses,

### Suggestions for discussions on Developers Day

-   JSON roll out to other servers and clients? (jw)
-   Firming up of the authentication DAS standard so the registry and
    writeback are consistent (jw)
-   Add support for conditional get (If-Modified-Since - reply only if
    modified since the modified since header) ? (jw)

### Possible DAS related Talks

DAS Registry - new architecture and capabilities (jw)
