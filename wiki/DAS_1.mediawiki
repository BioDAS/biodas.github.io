== About DAS/1 ==

The original version 1 specification, written by Lincoln Stein, Sean Eddy, and Robin Dowell, is the basis for a number of clients and servers. More than 200 DAS/1 servers are currently running worldwide including [http://www.wormbase.org/ WormBase], [http://www.flybase.org/ FlyBase], [http://www.ensembl.org/ Ensembl], [http://www.tigr.org/ TIGR],  [http://genome.ucsc.edu/ UCSC], and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/das-srv/uniprot/das UniProt]. A number of websites and software applications are based on DAS.


The DAS/1 specification is available at http://www.biodas.org/documents/spec.html

[[DAS/1/Overview]] provides a glossary and list of concepts.

== How to set up a DAS/1 server ==

In general it is quite easy to set up DAS server. All the server implementations are easy to set up.
Most server implementations allow easy setup using ready provided data-adaptors (e.g. for GFF files).
For custom data simple plugins can be written to quickly provide your data via DAS.

DAS server implementations are available in several programming languages:

* Perl

 [http://biodas.org/servers/LDAS.html LDAS]

* Java
