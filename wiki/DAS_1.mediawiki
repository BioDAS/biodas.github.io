<big>'''The DAS/1 Protocol'''</big>


== About DAS/1 ==

The original version 1 specification, written by Lincoln Stein and Robin Dowell, is the basis for a number of clients and servers. More than 200 DAS/1 servers are currently running worldwide including [http://www.wormbase.org/ WormBase], [http://www.flybase.org/ FlyBase], [http://www.ensembl.org/ Ensembl], [http://www.tigr.org/ TIGR],  [http://genome.ucsc.edu/ UCSC], and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/das-srv/uniprot/das UniProt]. A number of websites and software applications are based on DAS.


The DAS/1 specification is currently available in version 1.53 from
http://www.biodas.org/documents/spec.html

== How to set up a DAS/1 server ==

In general it is quite easy to set up DAS server. All the server implementations are easy to set up.
Most server implementations allow easy setup using ready provided data-adaptors (e.g. for GFF files).
For custom data simple plugins can be written to quickly provide your data via DAS.

DAS server implementations are available in several programming languages:

* Perl

 [http://biodas.org/servers/LDAS.html LDAS]

* Java

== Publishing and Discovery of DAS/1 sources ==

The DAS/1 specification does not define how to publish or discover DAS sources. Due to the
success of DAS and the large number of sources that are spread around the world it is not easy
to keep track of these. The DAS registration server at [http://www.dasregistry.org www.dasregistry.org]
provides a repository where people can publish and  share their DAS sources with the community. 

The DAS registry provdies a Web interface so users can search for available DAS source. For 
DAS-clients an XML interface is available that allows to obtain the listing programmatically.
