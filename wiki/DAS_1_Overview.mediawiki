<big>'''An Overview of the Concepts Concerning the Distributed Annotation System (DAS/1)'''</big>

NOTE: Some, but not all, concepts are applicable to the [[DAS/2]] version of the specification.

== Information Source ==

The full specification, available at http://www.biodas.org/documents/spec.html, serves as the primary source for this document and will be plagiarized without explicit notice. Any reference to this document will be made through the convention <U>Specs</U>. 

== DAS Glossary ==
(Definitions later defined are _italicized_; queries are *bolded*; optional portions within names are [bracketed].)

=== Distributed Annotation System (DAS) === 
A server system for the sharing of <I>Reference Sequences</I>, a system<I> </I>conceptually composed of a <I>Reference Server </I>and <I>Annotation Server(s)</I>.

=== [Reference] Sequence === 
A sequence, consisting of a set of <I>entry points</I> into the sequence and of the lengths of each entry point, which possesses a <I>reference sequence ID</I>.

=== [Reference] Sequence ID === 
The identification for a sequence, which corresponds to sequences of either a low-level (<I>e.g.</I>, clones) or a high-level (<I>e.g.</I>, contigs) and which is composed of any set of printable characters, save for the colon, newline, tab, and carriage return characters.

=== Entry point === 
A position defined for each genome at which the server may begin dispensing data for a sequence, for a given length (of variable size), <I>e.g.</I>, the head of a chromosome, the beginning of a series of contigs, and the beginning of a contig. A list of entry points for a given species may be retrieved via <B>entry_points</B>.

=== Annotation Server ===
A server specialized for returning lists of <I>annotations </I>across a certain segment of the genome.

=== Reference [Sequence] Server === 
An annotation server that, given a reference sequence ID, can also return the following data:

# The raw DNA of the sequence;
# The annotations of the &quot;component&quot; of a <I>category </I>(<I>E.g.</I>, a contig is the component of a chromosome; thus, reference servers can return the annotation for a contig);
# The annotations of &quot;supercomponents&quot; of a <I>category </I>(<I>E.g.</I>, a chromosome is the supercomponent of a contig.).

=== Annotation === 
An entity which:
# Is anchored to the genome map via a stop and start value relative to the reference subsequence;
# Possesses an ID unique to the server and a structured description of its nature and attributes;
# Optionally associated with Web URLs providing human-readable information about the annotation (via <B>link</B>);
# Possesses <I>types</I>, <I>methods</I>, and <I>categories</I>.

=== [Annotation] Type ===
An entity selected from a list of types which have biological significance and which roughly correspond to EMBL/GenBank feature table tags, <I>e.g.</I>, exon, intron, CDS, and splice3.

=== [Annotation] Method === 
A description of how the annotated feature was discovered, possibly including a reference to a software program.

=== [Annotation] Category === 
A intentionally broad functional genre that can be used to filter, group, and sort annotations, <I>e.g.</I>, homology, variation, and transcribed. (For the sake of consistency, <I>cf.</I> <U>Specs</U>: &quot;Feature Types and Categories&quot; for a general list of types and categories.)

=== Source === 
A project containing data on DAS (a list of which may be retrieved via <B>dsn</B>).

=== Stylesheet ===
The server's non-binding recommendations on formatting retrieved annotations for a given source (via <B>stylesheet</B>), using a General Feature Format (GFF) document. (<I>Cf.</I>, <U>Specs</U>: &quot;The Queries: Retrieving the Stylesheet&quot; and <U>Specs</U>: &quot;Glyph Types.&quot;)

== DAS Queries == 

A query can be made via a URL according to HTTP conventions, through either GET or (more preferably because of size) POST. The response is composed of:
# A standard HTTP header with DAS status information pertaining to the validity of the query (<I>cf.</I> <U>Specs</U>: &quot;Client/Server Interactions: The Response.&quot;);
# (Optionally) an XML file containing the answer to the query, according to the specifications listed in <U>Specs</U>: "The Queries".

''PREFIX'' denotes the URL prefix for the DAS server, e.g., http://servlet.sanger.ac.uk:8080 is the prefix for &lt;http://servlet.sanger.ac.uk:8080/das/dsn&gt;.
''DAS'' denotes the Data Source Name for a data source.

== Genome Assembly ==

</B></FONT><P>In a client application, Genome Assembly consists of moving &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; (the nomenclature of the <U>Specs</U>, analogous to zooming &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot;), along component children and supercomponent parent(s) <SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP>. Genome Assembly occurs only upon Reference Servers, a necessary deduction from its definition. This data is contained within the TYPE description for a feature. (<I>Cf.</I> <U>Specs</U>: &quot;Fetching Sequence Assemblies.)

<P>Thus, in describing such a paradigm, the <U>Specs</U> appear to convey that the client application will have to assemble information for a given segment from its component children (<I>i.e.</I>, moving down). (<I>E.g.</I>, a requested segment of a chromosome must be composed by the assembly of several contigs.) Conversely, this paradigm simply facilitates the client application to visit the supercomponent category (<I>i.e.</I>, moving up). (<I>E.g.</I>, a user would like to zoom out from a contig to view the entire chromosome.) However, the programmer should note well that it is a logical possibility for a segment to span more than one supercomponent parent (<I>e.g.</I>, a segment may span two contigs).

<HR>

<A NAME="#1"></A><P><SUP>1</SUP> Following Lincoln Stein, I use the words <I>component</I> and <I>supercomponent</I> to refer to categories alone. (<I>E.g.</I>, the category contig is a component of the category chromosome, whereas chromosome is a supercomponent of contig.) I shall use the words <I>children</I> and <I>parent(s)</I> to refer to entities of the given category. (<I>E.g.</I>, contigs 17, 18, 19, and 20 are the children of the parent chromosome 4.)
