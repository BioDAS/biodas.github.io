<big>'''The DAS/2 Protocol'''</big>


== About DAS/2 ==

DAS/2 is a more flexible and powerful version of the original [[DAS/1]]. The DAS/2 code base consists of:

# [http://biodas.org/documents/das2/das2_protocol.html The DAS/2 specification]
# [http://das.biopackages.net/das/genome A publically accessible DAS/2 server implementation] (open source code available from the [http://www.gmod.org/ GMOD project])
# [http://genoviz.sourceforge.net An open-source DAS/2 client implementation]
# [http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasypus An open-source client library and server validation suite] 

== DAS/2 History ==

DAS/2 evolved from [[DAS/1]] through a community-driven process, informed by a variety of [http://biodas.org/RFCs/index.html RFCs (Requests for Comment)] received from the community of users and implementers of the spec. As of November 2006, the [http://biodas.org/documents/das2/das2_get.html retrieval portion of the DAS/2 spec] has stabilized. Implementers can rely on this for their DAS/2-based development efforts.

DAS/2 development officially commenced in July 2004 when a 2-year [http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/CRISP_LIB.getdoc?textkey=6712060&p_grant_num=1R01HG003040-01&p_query=(DAS)&ticket=15416031&p_audit_session_id=72191905&p_audit_score=100&p_audit_numfound=1&p_keywords=DAS NIH grant] was funded. Participating in the DAS/2 grant are Affymetrix, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, the European Bioinformatics Institute/Sanger Center, and Dalke Scientific.

Given that the DAS/2 specification is not backward compatible with the DAS/1 version, existing DAS software will continue to support DAS/1. A [http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/das2/2006-October/000867.html DAS proxy server is in development] that will permit a DAS/1 server to be accessed by DAS/2 clients.

== Clients ==

The following software packages operate as clients capable of interacting with servers supporting the DAS/2 protocol:

* [http://genoviz.sourceforge.net IGB - Integrated Genome Browser]
* [http://www.gmod.org/ggb/ GBrowse - Generic Genome Browser]

== Servers ==

The following software packages operate as servers capable of providing data in response to queries conforming with the DAS/2 protocol:

* [http://das.biopackages.net/das/genome Biopackages DAS/2 server] - a DAS/2 reference implementation
* [http://netaffxdas.affymetrix.com/das2 Affymetrix Public DAS/2 server]
