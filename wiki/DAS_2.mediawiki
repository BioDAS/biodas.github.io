<big>'''The DAS/2 Protocol'''</big>

== About DAS/2 ==

DAS/2 is a more flexible and powerful version of the original [[DAS/1]]. The DAS/2 code base consists of:

# [http://biodas.org/documents/das2/das2_protocol.html The DAS/2 specification]
# [http://das.biopackages.net/das/genome A publically accessible DAS/2 server implementation] (open source code available from the [http://www.gmod.org/ GMOD project])
# [http://genoviz.sourceforge.net An open-source DAS/2 client implementation]
# [http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasypus An open-source client library and server validation suite] 

See [[DAS/2#CVS Access]] for details on retrieving code related to these projects.

== DAS/2 History ==

DAS/2 evolved from [[DAS/1]] through a community-driven process, informed by a variety of [http://biodas.org/RFCs/index.html RFCs (Requests for Comment)] received from the community of users and implementers of the spec. As of November 2006, the [http://biodas.org/documents/das2/das2_get.html retrieval portion of the DAS/2 spec] has stabilized. Implementers can rely on this for their DAS/2-based development efforts.

DAS/2 development officially commenced in July 2004 when a 2-year [http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/CRISP_LIB.getdoc?textkey=6712060&p_grant_num=1R01HG003040-01&p_query=(DAS)&ticket=15416031&p_audit_session_id=72191905&p_audit_score=100&p_audit_numfound=1&p_keywords=DAS NIH grant] was funded. Participating in the DAS/2 grant are Affymetrix, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, the European Bioinformatics Institute/Sanger Center, and Dalke Scientific.

Given that the DAS/2 specification is not backward compatible with the DAS/1 version, existing DAS software will continue to support DAS/1. A [http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/das2/2006-October/000867.html DAS proxy server is in development] that will permit a DAS/1 server to be accessed by DAS/2 clients.

== Clients ==

The following software packages operate as clients capable of interacting with servers supporting the DAS/2 protocol:

* [http://genoviz.sourceforge.net IGB - Integrated Genome Browser]
* [http://www.gmod.org/ggb/ GBrowse - Generic Genome Browser]

== Servers ==

The following software packages operate as servers capable of providing data in response to queries conforming with the DAS/2 protocol:

* [http://das.biopackages.net/das/genome Biopackages DAS/2 server] - a DAS/2 reference implementation
* [http://netaffxdas.affymetrix.com/das2 Affymetrix Public DAS/2 server]

== Validation Suite ==

The DAS/2 grant included the development of a validation service to verify conformance of DAS/2 clients and servers with the DAS/2 specification. This service is available here http://cgi.biodas.org:8080/. If it is down, please notify the [http://biodas.org/mailman/listinfo/das2 discussion list].

== CVS Access ==

There are separate repositories for the DAS/2 specification, DAS/2 client and server reference implementations, and the validation suite. These are for developers only since they do not represent stable releases and may contain modifications that contain bugs. The one exception is the schema for the retrieval portion of the DAS/2 spec, which is now stable.

* DAS/2 spec: 
** <code>:pserver:cvs@cvs.biodas.org:/home/repository/biodas</code>
