<big>'''The DAS/2 Protocol'''</big>


== About DAS/2 ==

DAS/2 is a more flexible and powerful version of the original [[DAS/1]]. The DAS/2 code base consists of:

# [http://biodas.org/documents/das2/das2_protocol.html The DAS/2 specification]
# [http://das.biopackages.net/das/genome A publically accessible DAS/2 server implementation] (open source code available from the [http://www.gmod.org/ GMOD project])
# [http://genoviz.sourceforge.net An open-source DAS/2 client implementation]
# [http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasypus An open-source client library and server validation suite] 


== DAS/2 History ==

DAS/2 evolved from the DAS/1 version through a community-driven process, informed by a variety of [http://biodas.org/RFCs/index.html RFCs (Requests for Comment) received from the user community]. DAS/2 development officially commenced in July 2004 when a 2-year [http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/CRISP_LIB.getdoc?textkey=6712060&p_grant_num=1R01HG003040-01&p_query=(DAS)&ticket=15416031&p_audit_session_id=72191905&p_audit_score=100&p_audit_numfound=1&p_keywords=DAS NIH grant] was funded. Participating in the DAS/2 grant are Affymetrix, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, the European Bioinformatics Institute/Sanger Center, and Dalke Scientific.
