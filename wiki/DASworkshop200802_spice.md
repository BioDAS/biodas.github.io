SPICE
=====

a browser for protein sequences, structures and their annotations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

There are various ways to launch SPICE.

### Ensembl

The PDB\_Spice DAS track in the Ensembl protview and contigviews allows
to show protein structure mappings/

e.g.
[<http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/protview?peptide=ENSP00000365116>](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/protview?peptide=ENSP00000365116)

enable the track in this view and click on the track and then again on
the protein structure image. This allows you to launch SPICE.

### Pfam

SPICE can be easily linked to from external web sites.

Find the protein structure 1cdg in Pfam:
<http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/structure?entry=1cdg&type=Structure>

click on view structure and select SPICE again.

notice how the PFAM track is on top of the UniProt display. map the PFAM
domains on the structure.

A multiple structure alignment viewer
-------------------------------------

### CASP 7 results

The [CASP 7 - target
view](http://www.predictioncenter.org/casp/casp7/public/cgi-bin/results.cgi)
allows to launch SPICE again

white... solved target. others: predictions for various targets. sort
predictions by score switch between sequence based on structure based
alignment algorithms.
