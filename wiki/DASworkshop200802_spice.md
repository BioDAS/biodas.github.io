SPICE
=====

a browser for protein sequences, structures and their annotations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

There are various ways to launch SPICE.

### Ensembl

The PDB\_Spice DAS track in the Ensembl protview and contigviews allows
to show protein structure mappings/

e.g.
[<http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/protview?peptide=ENSP00000365116>](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/protview?peptide=ENSP00000365116)

enable the track in this view and click on the track and then again on
the protein structure image. This allows you to launch SPICE.

### Pfam

SPICE can be easily linked to from external web sites.

Find the protein structure 1cdg in Pfam:
<http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/structure?entry=1cdg&type=Structure>

click on view structure and select SPICE again.
