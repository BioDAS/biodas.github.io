SPICE
=====

There are 2 main display modes in SPICE. As a single protein structure
browser and as a multiple protein structure alignment viewer.

A browser for protein sequences, structures and their annotations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

There are various ways to launch SPICE.

### Ensembl

The PDB\_Spice DAS track in the Ensembl protview and contigviews allows
to show protein structure mappings/

e.g.
[<http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/protview?peptide=ENSP00000365116>](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/protview?peptide=ENSP00000365116)

enable the track in this view and click on the track and then again on
the protein structure image. This allows you to launch SPICE.

### Pfam

SPICE can be easily linked to from external web sites.

Find the protein structure 1cdg in Pfam:
<http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/structure?entry=1boh&type=Structure>

click on view structure and select SPICE again.

notice how the PFAM track is on top of the UniProt display. map the PFAM
domains on the structure.

Do the PFAM domains correspond to what you would consider structural
domains?

Find the hydrophobicity DAS source. (in the UniProt display, very much
at the bottom) map the Kyle-Doolittle hydrophobicity onto the protein
structure.

### SPICE homepage

Just for completeness, you can of course also launch SPICE via its
homepage at
[<http://www.efamily.org.uk/software/dasclients/spice/>](http://www.efamily.org.uk/software/dasclients/spice/)

A multiple structure alignment viewer
-------------------------------------

### CASP 7 results

The [CASP 7 - target
view](http://www.predictioncenter.org/casp/casp7/public/cgi-bin/results.cgi)
allows to launch SPICE in the structure alignment mode

white... solved target.

others: predictions for various targets.

sort predictions by score

switch between sequence based on structure based alignment algorithms.
