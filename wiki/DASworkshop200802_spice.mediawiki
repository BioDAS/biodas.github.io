=SPICE=
==a browser for protein sequences, structures and their annotations== 

There are various ways to launch SPICE.

===Ensembl===

The PDB_Spice DAS track in the Ensembl protview and contigviews allows to show protein structure mappings/

e.g. 
[http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/protview?peptide=ENSP00000365116 http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/protview?peptide=ENSP00000365116]

enable the  track in this view and click on the track and then again on the protein structure image. This allows you to launch SPICE.

===Pfam===

SPICE can be easily linked to from external web sites.

Find the protein structure 1cdg in Pfam:
http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/structure?entry=1cdg&type=Structure

click on  view structure and select SPICE again.

notice how the PFAM track is on top of the UniProt display.
map the PFAM domains on the structure. 

Do the PFAM domains correspond to what you would consider structural domains?

What could the Pfam-B domain be?

==A multiple structure alignment viewer==

===CASP 7 results===

The [http://www.predictioncenter.org/casp/casp7/public/cgi-bin/results.cgi CASP 7 - target view] allows to launch SPICE again

white... solved target.
others: predictions for various targets.
sort predictions by score
switch between sequence based on structure based alignment algorithms.
