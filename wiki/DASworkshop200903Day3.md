This page is for people attending day 3 of the workshop to put down
their ideas and volunteer to host a session on a topic or write some
minutes of the meeting on the biodas wiki site, so we have a record of
what was discussed and what the outcomes were or ideally some code to
work with.

-   My current suggestion for the format would be to have the 1.6 spec
    and the DAS1/DAS2 merger topics discussed in the first 2 hrs of the
    day and be open to everybody. Then have groups split up into the
    remainder of the topics?

### DAS 1.6 spec and where to go with the Registry

Host: Jonathan Warren and Andy Jenkinson Secretary: Jonathan Warren and
Andy Jenkinson

[1.6\_Examples](1.6_Examples "wikilink")

### DAS1/DAS2 merger

### DAS writeback

### Adapting Java DAS client libraries for alignment and PDB file retrieval for clients that dont use BioJava

### Ajax das client/server library (allow DAS server discovery and retrieval on the browser page)

Graphical Representation of data

### DAS interfaces to sequence analysis tools

### BioSapiens ontology lookup and general Ontologies

How to represent the ontology in DAS, e.g. JR Macias' "term" command DAS
vs. ontologies, how and why This topic was suggeseted because I'd like
to understand how 'ontologies' (in general) are implemented in DAS and
how this relates to the feature annotation models in
[Chado](/wiki/Chado "wikilink") or [GFF3](GFF3 "wikilink"), for example. How
should an annotator use an ontology? How should the use of an ontology
be reflected in the client behaviour? What about DAS ontology servers
(and the 'term' DAS command)? This topic dosn't really fit with the idea
of a 'hackathon', but is a very interesting aspect of DAS. i.e.

What are:

-   [Ontodas](/wiki/Ontodas "wikilink")
-   [DAS Protein Ontology](/wiki/DAS_Protein_Ontology "wikilink")
-   [Ontology Lookup Service](/wiki/Ontology_Lookup_Service "wikilink")
-   The [BioSapians](/wiki/BioSapians "wikilink") (feature type?) ontology
-   The ontology of 'input filters' from [EMBRACE](/wiki/EMBRACE "wikilink")
    This is an effort by the EMBRACE project to define ontologies for
    use in registering web services in the EMBRACE registry and later in
    the BioCatalogue registry. The ontology will cover the terms used in
    EMBRACE servcies, including BioMart and EMBOSS - both of which
    already have well-defined terms which will be used to populate
    the ontology. This will be contributed to the OBO foundry (like the
    other ontologies used in DAS) and can be extended to cover
    algorithms to give a better description of a service, its inputs,
    parameters and outputs. Contact Peter Rice pmr@ebi.ac.uk for
    more information.
