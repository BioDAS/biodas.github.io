This page is for people attending day 3 of the workshop to put down
their ideas and volunteer to host a session on a topic or write some
minutes of the meeting on the biodas wiki site, so we have a record of
what was discussed and what the outcomes were or ideally some code to
work with.

-   My current suggestion for the format would be to have the 1.6 spec
    and the DAS1/DAS2 merger topics discussed in the first 2 hrs of the
    day and be open to everybody. Then have groups split up into the
    remainder of the topics?

DAS 1.6 spec and where to go with the Registry
----------------------------------------------

### Host

Jonathan Warren and Andy Jenkinson

### Secretary

Jonathan Warren and Andy Jenkinson

DAS1/DAS2 merger
----------------

DAS writeback
-------------

Adapting Java DAS client libraries for alignment and PDB file retrieval for clients that dont use BioJava
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ajax das client/server library (allow DAS server discovery and retrieval on the browser page)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graphical Representation of data
--------------------------------

DAS interfaces to sequence analysis tools
-----------------------------------------

BioSapiens ontology lookup
--------------------------

DAS vs. ontologies, how and why
-------------------------------

This topic was suggeseted because I'd like to understand how
'ontologies' (in general) are implemented in DAS and how this relates to
the feature annotation models in [Chaddo](/wiki/Chaddo "wikilink") or
[GFF3](/wiki/GFF3 "wikilink"), for example. This topic dosn't really fit with
the idea of a 'hackathon'.
