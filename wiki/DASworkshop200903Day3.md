This page is for people attending day 3 of the workshop to put down
their ideas and volunteer to host a session on a topic or write some
minutes of the meeting on the biodas wiki site, so we have a record of
what was discussed and what the outcomes were or ideally some code to
work with.

-   My current suggestion for the format would be to have the 1.6 spec
    and the DAS1/DAS2 merger topics discussed in the first 2 hrs of the
    day and be open to everybody. Then have groups split up into the
    remainder of the topics?

DAS 1.6 spec and where to go with the Registry
----------------------------------------------

### Host

Jonathan Warren and Andy Jenkinson

### Secretary

Jonathan Warren and Andy Jenkinson

DAS1/DAS2 merger
----------------

DAS writeback
-------------

Adapting Java DAS client libraries for alignment and PDB file retrieval for clients that dont use BioJava
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ajax das client/server library (allow DAS server discovery and retrieval on the browser page)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graphical Representation of data
--------------------------------

DAS interfaces to sequence analysis tools
-----------------------------------------

BioSapiens ontology lookup
--------------------------

DAS vs. ontologies, how and why
-------------------------------

This topic was suggeseted because I'd like to understand how
'ontologies' (in general) are implemented in DAS and how this relates to
the feature annotation models in [Chado](/wiki/Chado "wikilink") or
[GFF3](/wiki/GFF3 "wikilink"), for example. How should an annotator use an
ontology? How should the use of an ontology be reflected in the client
behaviour? What about DAS ontology servers (and the 'term' DAS command)?
This topic dosn't really fit with the idea of a 'hackathon', but is a
very interesting aspect of DAS. i.e.

What are:

-   [Ontodas](/wiki/Ontodas "wikilink")
-   [DAS Protein Ontology](/wiki/DAS_Protein_Ontology "wikilink")
-   [Ontology Lookup Service](/wiki/Ontology_Lookup_Service "wikilink")
-   The [BioSapians](/wiki/BioSapians "wikilink") (feature type?) ontology
-   The ontology of 'input filters' from [EMbrace](/wiki/EMbrace "wikilink")

  
???
