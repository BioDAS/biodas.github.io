DAS Registry: Publishing and Discovery of DAS Servers
-----------------------------------------------------

The DAS registration server at
[www.dasregistry.org](http://www.dasregistry.org) provides a repository
where people can publish and share their DAS data sources (i.e., server
locations and available data) with the community.

The [DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink") and [DAS/2](DAS/2 "wikilink")
specifications do not define how to publish or discover DAS data sources
(servers). Due to the success of DAS/1 and the large number of sources
that are spread around the world it is not easy to keep track of these.

The DAS registry provdies a Web interface so users can search for
available [DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink") or [DAS/2](DAS/2 "wikilink") data
sources. For DAS-clients, an XML interface is available that allows a
programmatic way to retrieve data source listings, and several DAS
clients now make use of this.

For more info on this please see the
[documentation](http://www.dasregistry.org/help_scripting.jsp).
