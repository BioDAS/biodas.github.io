==DAS Registry: Publishing and Discovery of DAS Servers==

The DAS/1 and DAS/2 specifications do not define how to publish or discover DAS sources (servers). Due to the
success of DAS and the large number of sources that are spread around the world it is not easy
to keep track of these. The DAS registration server at [http://www.dasregistry.org www.dasregistry.org]
provides a repository where people can publish and  share their DAS sources with the community. 

The DAS registry provdies a Web interface so users can search for available DAS/1 or DAS/2 data sources. For 
DAS-clients an XML interface is available that allows to obtain the listing programmatically.

For more info on this please see the [http://www.dasregistry.org/help_scripting.jsp documentation].
