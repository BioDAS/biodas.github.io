==DAS Registry: Publishing and Discovery of DAS Servers==

The DAS registration server at [http://www.dasregistry.org www.dasregistry.org]
provides a repository where people can publish and share their DAS data sources (i.e., server locations and available data) with the community. 

The [[DAS/1]] and [[DAS/2]] specifications do not define how to publish or discover DAS data sources (servers). Due to the success of DAS/1 and the large number of sources that are spread around the world it is not easy
to keep track of these.

The DAS registry provdies a Web interface so users can search for available [[DAS/1]] or [[DAS/2]] data sources. For DAS-clients, an XML interface is available that allows a programmatic way to retrieve data source listings, and several DAS clients now make use of this.

For more info on this please see the [http://www.dasregistry.org/help_scripting.jsp documentation].

==Installing local version of DAS registry==
Some very rough [[DAS registry installation notes]] on Gregg Helt's attempts to get a local installation of the DAS registry running, and modifications to the registry code to support a merged DAS1/DAS2 registry.
