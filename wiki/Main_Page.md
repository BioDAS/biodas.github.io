<big>**Welcome To BioDAS.org**</big>

<http://biodas.org/> will eventually be migrated to a wiki format. In
the meantime, please continue to use the original site. If you want to
pitch in and help this migration, send a note to the [BioDAS discussion
list](http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/das2).

About DAS
---------

The <b>Distributed Annotation System</b> (DAS) defines a communication
protocol used to exchange biological annotations. It is motivated by the
idea that annotations should not be provided by single centralized
databases, but instead be spread over multiple sites. Data distribution,
performed by DAS servers, is separated from visualization, which is done
by DAS clients.

DAS is a client-server system in which a single client integrates
information from multiple servers. It allows a single machine to gather
up genome annotation information from multiple distant web sites,
collate the information, and display it to the user in a single view.
Little coordination is needed among the various information providers.

DAS is heavily used in the genome bioinformatics community. Over the
last years we have also seen growing acceptance in the protein sequence
and structure communities.

What can I do with DAS ?
------------------------

A number of sites and applications is available that are using DAS.

The Protocol
------------

Currently there are two versions of the DAS protocol

### [DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink")

[DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink") is the original version of the specification
written by Lincoln Stein and Robin Dowell and is the basis for a number
of existing clients and servers. More than 200 DAS/1 servers are
currently running worldwide including
[WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/),
[FlyBase](http://www.flybase.org/), [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/),
[TIGR](http://www.tigr.org/), [UCSC](http://genome.ucsc.edu/), and
[UniProt](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot-das/). For a listing of all
available DAS sources please proceed to <http://www.dasregistry.org>

### [DAS/2](/wiki/DAS/2 "wikilink")

[DAS/2](/wiki/DAS/2 "wikilink") is the latest version of the DAS specification
and builds on the capabilities of the original [DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink")
spec. See the [DAS/2](/wiki/DAS/2 "wikilink") page for more information.

Mailing Lists
-------------

There are currently two separate mailing lists for public discussions
about DAS, one for [DAS/1](http://biodas.org/mailman/listinfo/das) and
one for [DAS/2](http://biodas.org/mailman/listinfo/das2). See the
[BioDAS mailing list](http://biodas.org/documents/biodas-lists.html)
page for more info.
