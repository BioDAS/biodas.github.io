About DAS
---------

The <b>Distributed Annotation System</b> (DAS) defines a communication
protocol used to exchange [biological sequence
annotations](http://wikiomics.org/wiki/Viewing_and_sharing_genome_annotations).
It is motivated by the idea that such annotations should not be provided
by single centralized databases, but should instead be spread over
multiple sites. Data distribution, performed by DAS servers, is
separated from visualization, which is done by DAS clients.

DAS is a client-server system in which a single client integrates
information from multiple servers. It allows a single machine to gather
up sequence annotation information from multiple distant web sites,
collate the information, and display it to the user in a single view.
Little coordination is needed among the various information providers.

DAS is heavily used in the genome bioinformatics community. Over the
last years we have also seen growing acceptance in the protein sequence
and structure communities.

The Protocol
------------

Currently there are two versions of the DAS protocol

### [DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink")

[DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink") (or commonly "DAS") is the original version of
the specification written by Lincoln Stein, Sean Eddy, and Robin Dowell.
It is widely adopted and well supported, particularly throughout Europe,
and is the basis for a large number of existing clients and servers.
Though mature, the
[specification](http://www.biodas.org/documents/spec.html) continues to
be [extended](http://www.dasregistry.org/spec_1.53E.jsp) to cater for
the needs of the DAS community.

More than 200 DAS/1 servers are currently running worldwide including
[WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/),
[FlyBase](http://www.flybase.org/), [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/),
[TIGR](http://www.tigr.org/), [UCSC](http://genome.ucsc.edu/), and
[UniProt](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot-das/). For a listing of all
available DAS sources please proceed to the
[DasRegistry](/wiki/DasRegistry "wikilink") <http://www.dasregistry.org>

### [DAS/2](/wiki/DAS/2 "wikilink")

[DAS/2](/wiki/DAS/2 "wikilink") is the latest version of the DAS specification
and builds on the capabilities of the original [DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink")
spec. See the [DAS/2](/wiki/DAS/2 "wikilink") page for more information.

DAS workshop
------------

A [workshop on DAS](http://www.dasregistry.org/course.jsp) will be held
in February 2008 at the Genome Campus in Hinxton / Cambridge U.K. This
is an opportunity for newbies to learn about DAS and for the more
experienced to exchange ideas and present their latest developments.
