DAS Workshop 2009 is in progress!
---------------------------------

See the [DASworkshop200903](/wiki/DASworkshop200903 "wikilink") page for the
2009 workshop schedule.

About DAS
---------

The <b>Distributed Annotation System</b> (DAS) defines a communication
protocol used to exchange
[annotations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_project#Genome_annotation)
on genomic or protein sequences. It is motivated by the idea that such
annotations should not be provided by single centralized databases, but
should instead be spread over multiple sites. Data distribution,
performed by DAS servers, is separated from visualization, which is done
by DAS clients.

DAS is a client-server system in which a single client integrates
information from multiple servers. It allows a single machine to gather
up sequence annotation information from multiple distant web sites,
collate the information, and display it to the user in a single view.
Little coordination is needed among the various information providers.

DAS is heavily used in the genome bioinformatics community. Over the
last years we have also seen growing acceptance in the protein sequence
and structure communities.

The Protocol
------------

The original DAS specification was written by Lincoln Stein, Sean Eddy,
and Robin Dowell. It is widely adopted and well supported, particularly
throughout Europe, and is the basis for a large number of existing
clients and servers. Though mature, the protocol continues to be
[extended](http://www.dasregistry.org/spec_1.53E.jsp) to cater for the
needs of the DAS community.

Hundreds of DAS servers are currently running worldwide including
[WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/),
[FlyBase](http://www.flybase.org/), [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/),
[TIGR](http://www.tigr.org/), [UCSC](http://genome.ucsc.edu/), and
[UniProt](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot-das/). For a listing of all
available DAS sources please proceed to the
[DasRegistry](/wiki/DasRegistry "wikilink") <http://www.dasregistry.org>

See the [DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink") page for more details.

DAS events
----------

-   There are several upcoming training courses that include DAS
    components
-   DAS will be represented at the [BOSC
    2008](http://open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2008) conference

See the [Current events](/wiki/Current_events "wikilink") page for details of
these and past events.

[DAS/2](/wiki/DAS/2 "wikilink")
-------------------------

[DAS/2](/wiki/DAS/2 "wikilink") is an offshoot of the DAS specification and
builds on the capabilities of the original [DAS/1](/wiki/DAS/1 "wikilink")
spec. See the [DAS/2](/wiki/DAS/2 "wikilink") page for more information.
