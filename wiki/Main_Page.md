<big>**Welcome To BioDAS.org**</big>

<http://biodas.org/> will eventually be migrated to a wiki format. In
the meantime, please continue to use the original site. If you want to
pitch in and help this migration, send a note to the [BioDAS discussion
list](http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/das2).

About DAS
---------

The <b>Distributed Annotation System</b> (DAS) defines a communication
protocol used to exchange biological annotations. It is motivated by the
idea that annotations should not be provided by single centralized
databases, but instead be spread over multiple sites. Data distribution,
performed by DAS servers, is separated from visualization, which is done
by DAS clients.

(DAS) is a client-server system in which a single client integrates
information from multiple servers. It allows a single machine to gather
up genome annotation information from multiple distant web sites,
collate the information, and display it to the user in a single view.
Little coordination is needed among the various information providers.
