== About DAS ==

The <b>Distributed Annotation System</b> (DAS) defines a communication protocol used 
to exchange [http://wikiomics.org/wiki/Viewing_and_sharing_genome_annotations biological  annotations]. 
It is motivated by the idea that such annotations 
should not be provided by single centralized databases, but should instead be spread 
over multiple sites. Data distribution, performed by DAS servers, is separated
from visualization, which is done by DAS clients.

DAS is a client-server system in which a single client integrates information from 
multiple servers. It allows a single machine to gather up sequence annotation 
information from multiple distant web sites, collate the information, and display it
to the user in a single view. Little coordination is needed among the various 
information providers.

DAS is heavily used in the genome bioinformatics community. Over the last years we have also
seen growing acceptance in the protein sequence and structure communities.

== The Protocol ==

Currently there are two versions of the DAS protocol

=== [[DAS/1]] ===

[[DAS/1]] (or commonly "DAS") is the original version of the specification written by Lincoln Stein, Sean Eddy, and Robin Dowell. It is widely adopted and well supported, particularly throughout Europe, and is the basis for a large number of existing clients and servers. Though mature, the protocol continues to be [http://www.dasregistry.org/spec_1.53E.jsp extended] to cater for the needs of the DAS community.

More than 200 DAS/1 servers are currently running worldwide including [http://www.wormbase.org/ WormBase], [http://www.flybase.org/ FlyBase], [http://www.ensembl.org/ Ensembl], [http://www.tigr.org/ TIGR],  [http://genome.ucsc.edu/ UCSC], and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot-das/ UniProt]. For a listing of all available DAS sources please proceed to the [[DasRegistry]] http://www.dasregistry.org

=== [[DAS/2]] ===

[[DAS/2]] is an offshoot of the DAS specification and builds on the capabilities of the original [[DAS/1]] spec. See the [[DAS/2]] page for more information.

== DAS workshop ==

A [[DASworkshop200802|workshop on DAS]] will be held in February 2008 at the Genome Campus in Hinxton / Cambridge U.K. This is an opportunity for newbies to learn about DAS and for the more experienced to exchange ideas and present their latest developments.
