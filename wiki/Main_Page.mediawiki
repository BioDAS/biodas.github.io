== About DAS ==

The <b>Distributed Annotation System</b> (DAS) defines a communication protocol used 
to exchange [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_project#Genome_annotation annotations] on genomic or protein sequences. 
It is motivated by the idea that such annotations 
should not be provided by single centralized databases, but should instead be spread 
over multiple sites. Data distribution, performed by DAS servers, is separated
from visualization, which is done by DAS clients.

DAS is a client-server system in which a single client integrates information from 
multiple servers. It allows a single machine to gather up sequence annotation 
information from multiple distant web sites, collate the information, and display it
to the user in a single view. Little coordination is needed among the various 
information providers.

DAS is heavily used in the genome bioinformatics community. Over the last years we have also
seen growing acceptance in the protein sequence and structure communities.

More information can be found about DAS here: [[Everything DAS]].

== The Protocol ==

The original [[DAS specification]] was written by Lincoln Stein, Sean Eddy, and Robin Dowell. It is widely adopted and well supported, particularly throughout Europe, and is the basis for a large number of existing clients and servers. Though mature, the protocol continues to be [http://www.dasregistry.org/spec_1.53E.jsp extended] to cater for the needs of the DAS community.

Hundreds of DAS servers are currently running worldwide including [http://www.wormbase.org/ WormBase], [http://www.flybase.org/ FlyBase], [http://www.ensembl.org/ Ensembl], [http://www.tigr.org/ TIGR],  [http://genome.ucsc.edu/ UCSC], and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot-das/ UniProt]. For a listing of all available DAS sources please proceed to the [[DasRegistry]] http://www.dasregistry.org

See the [[DAS/1]] page for more details.

== DAS events ==

* There are several upcoming training courses that include DAS components
* DAS will be represented at the [http://open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2008 BOSC 2008] conference

See the [[Current events]] page for details of these and past events.

== [[DAS/2]] ==

[[DAS/2]] is an offshoot of the DAS specification and builds on the capabilities of the original [[DAS/1]] spec. See the [[DAS/2]] page for more information.
